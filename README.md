Algorithms are step-by-step processes designed to solve specific problems efficiently and optimally. In an interview context, preparing for algorithms involves studying various problem-solving techniques and strategies. This includes understanding algorithmic paradigms like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and graph traversal. Interviewers often test candidates on their ability to design, analyze, and implement algorithms to solve complex problems within time and space constraints. Successful preparation involves practicing algorithmic problem-solving, enhancing algorithmic thinking, and mastering common algorithmic patterns to excel in technical interviews.
