Lockboxes represent a problem-solving scenario often used in programming interviews. In this scenario, you're presented with a collection of lockboxes, each potentially containing a key to another lockbox. The goal is to determine whether you can use the keys to eventually open all the lockboxes. Solving the "Lockboxes" problem demonstrates your ability to manage relationships, use available resources wisely, and efficiently solve interconnected challenges. It assesses your problem-solving skills and logical reasoning, making it a common exercise in technical interviews.
